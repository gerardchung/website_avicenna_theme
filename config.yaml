    paragraph:
      - text: "I am a research fellow at the [Social Service Research Centre](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ssr/), National University of Singapore. I have a Ph.D. in social work from the University of

               I also identify as a methodologist where the through
               line connecting my research interests involved the use of computational
               social science methods and advanced statistical methods.\n\ "
