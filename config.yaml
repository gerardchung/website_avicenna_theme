  introduction:
    paragraph:
      - text: "I am from Singapore. I am a doctoral candidate at the University of 
               North Carolina at Chapel Hill [School of Social Work](https://ssw.unc.edu/).\n   "
      - text: " My dissertation will focus on risk factors of maltreatment rereports. My 
                [first paper](https://gerardchung.shinyapps.io/shiny_metaanalysis_effects/) 
                will be a meta-analysis of risk factors of maltreatment rereports. 
                My second paper will do a predictive risk modeling of risk factors. 
                My third paper will use a Bayesian spatiotemporal 
                framework to analyze risk factors associated with child maltreatment 
                rereports across counties of North Carolina.\n\ "
      - text: "My research interests include parenting, engaging fathers in services, 
               risk factors of child maltreatment, and predictive modeling. I also 
               identify as a methodologist in social work research where the through
               line connecting my research interests involved the use of computational
               social science methods and other advanced statistical methods.\n\ "
